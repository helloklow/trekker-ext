# Trekker

Trekker is a place for U.S. National Park enthusiasts to track which parks they have visited and find inspiration for their next park adventure. This application provides a comprehensive list of U.S. National Parks. Each park includes an enchanting photo alongside an informative summary. Create a Trekker account to track as you visit all 61 (and counting!) of America's richest landscapes. See which parks you have yet to visit and embark on your next epic trek!
